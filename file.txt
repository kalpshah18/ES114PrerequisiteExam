The sun sinks low, its warm light spills across the land, soft and gold. Birds chirp high in the trees, their songs fill the sky. Waves roll in and crash, their foam white on the shore. Kids dash and leap, feet bare on the cool sand, with joy bright on their faces. The air smells fresh, with hints of salt and earth. A soft breeze drifts through, light on the skin, and leaves sway as if they too can dance. The world hums with peace, calm yet alive, wrapped in a glow that feels pure and kind.
